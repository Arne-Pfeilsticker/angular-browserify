AngularJS + Browserify Project Template
=======================================

This is a small example/seed project for using AngularJS with Browserify. It demonstrates how to structure code by using CommonJS modules together with AngularJS dependency injection mechanisms. It also comes with a basic `gulpfile` that includes JSHint, Browserify, ngmin, a static asset server and live reload.
